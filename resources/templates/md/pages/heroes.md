I think it is important to have people that you look up to ... here are some of my heroes:

## [Dmitri Sotnikov](http://yogthos.net/)

Dmitri is a clojure/script powerhouse - I feel like he is involved in everything.

* [Web Development with Clojure](https://pragprog.com/book/dswdcloj2/web-development-with-clojure-second-edition)
* [Luminus](http://www.luminusweb.net/)
* [Macchiato](https://github.com/macchiato-framework)

## [Bruce Hauman](https://github.com/bhauman)

I am forever grateful for Bruce's contributions to the community.  I can't imagine front-end development without some of his tools.

* [figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel)
* [devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards)

## [Mike Thompson](https://github.com/mike-thompson-day8)

Mike helped land reagent on the map by creating and, more importantly, *documenting* re-frame.

* [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame)
* [re-com](https://github.com/Day8/re-com)

## [Antonin Hildebrand](https://github.com/darwin)

Antonin is a bleeding-edge developer ... he is always up to something cool.

* [cljs-devtools](https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-devtools)
* [dirac](https://github.com/binaryage/dirac)
* [chromex](https://github.com/binaryage/chromex)

## [Karsten Schmidt](https://github.com/postspectacular)

Karsten does much of his development using org-mode ... just can't get over how cool that is!  Take a peak at some of the repositories in [thi.ng](https://github.com/thi-ng).

## [James Reeves](https://github.com/weavejester)

This guy simply makes some of the most popular clojure libraries and his code is wonderful to read.

* [compjure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure)
* [hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup)
